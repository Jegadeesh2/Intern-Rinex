      <h2>Nature</h2>
      <p>
        India is a land where diversity makes its mark in every possible way.
        India’s geographies that define its physical existence are the major
        examples of this distinguishing trait. The country shows a beautiful
        coexistence of snow-clad trenches, warm sandy deserts, tropical beaches,
        lush green forests, all in one chunk of land. Nature tours are probably
        the best in India as they let you explore the different moods of the
        country. Whatever landscape one is looking for, India does not let him
        return disappointed.

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of
        Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends
        ancient local traditions with imported styles. Vernacular architecture
        is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally "science of
        construction" or "architecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan, explores
        how the laws of nature affect human dwellings it employs precise
        geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic
        constructs.As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by
        the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic
        mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied
        the "absolute". The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by
        orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been
        described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as "the jewel of Muslim art
        in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's
        heritage". Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British
        in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.

      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>
        The Government of India (ISO: Bhārat Sarkār; often abbreviated as GoI),
        also known as the Union Government or Central Government but often
        simply as the Centre,[a] is the national authority of the Republic of
        India, a federal democracy located in South Asia, consisting of 28 union
        states and eight union territories. Under the Constitution, there are
        three primary branches of government: the legislative, the executive and
        the judiciary, whose powers are vested in a bicameral Parliament, Prime
        Minister, aided by a Council of Ministers, and the Supreme Court
        respectively, with a President as Head of State. Through judicial
        evolution, the Parliament has lost its sovereignty as its amendments to
        the Constitution are subject to judicial intervention. Judicial
        appointments are made with negligible say from the executive or
        legislature.
